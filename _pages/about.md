I am Cao Yixin, a professor at Shanghai Innovation Institute, as well as Institute of Trustworthy Embodied AI, Fudan University. I obtained Ph.D. from KEG at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Li Juanzi. I have held positions as a research fellow, research assistant professor, and assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and Singapore Management University. I am a recipient of the National Youth Talent Program and the Shanghai Leading Talent Program. My research areas include natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and multimodal information processing. I have published over 60 papers at international renowned conferences and journals, with more than 11,000 citations on Google Scholar. My research achievements have been awarded the Best Paper/Nomination at two international conferences. I have received Lee Kong Chian Fellowship, Google South Asia & Southeast Asia Awards, and the AI2000 Most Influential Scholar honorable mention. I also serve as the demonstration program chair or area chair for multiple international conferences, and as a reviewer for international journals.
